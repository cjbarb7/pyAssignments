# Variables - placeholders for important values
"""
 Valid variable names consist of letters, numbers, and
 underscores (_) and start with a letter or underscore
"""
# Valid
num = 2
my_name = 3
__do__this = 12

# Invalid - uncomment to see errors
#i<3u = 9001
#this&that = 24
#me+u = 2

"""
Problem 1:
Below are 5 variable assignments. A few of those are invalid.
Comment out the invalid variable assignments to get rid of the errors by placing a "#' in front of the name.
"""
#9ish = 9.001
#it9 = 9
#it_10 = 10

Variables are also case sensitive
Problem 2:
Show that variables are case sensitive by assigning values to num and Num below.
"""
x = 1000000000
num = x
Num = x
print "Ex. 1:", num
print "Ex. 2:", Num

"""
Variable names should also be descriptive. Not only does
this remind you what they are for, it also prevents
the same variable for standing for multiple things on
accident.

Problem 3: The variable, 'myName' has already been created for you, just replace the string "Name" with your actual name. 
Additonally, create the following variables: address, age, email address. 
If they are lines of text, remember to use either ' ' or "" for strings. 
"""

# Good variable names
favorite_number = 1.8
minutes = 60
months = 12

# Bad variable names
nl = 26 #new line? number of letters? nil? number one?
mi = 6 # minutes? millennium? miles? do re mi?
mo = 5 # months? monster? more? favorite movies?

#Problem 3
myName = 'Name'

"""
It also is a good idea to avoid names that change color
when typed; those words have other purposes and can even
cause errors
Problem 4: Change the names of the variables below so that they are no longer a different color.
"""
# Not a good idea - the last one will cause errors. Why do you think? Because 'print' is a built in command. It prints something out!
